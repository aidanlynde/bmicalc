BMI Calculator Project
The BMI (Body Mass Index) Calculator is a simple web application that allows users to calculate their Body Mass Index based on their height and weight. BMI is a measure commonly used to assess whether a person has a healthy body weight relative to their height.

This project provides a user-friendly interface for users to input their height and weight and receive their BMI value along with a corresponding BMI category (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese). It can be used as a standalone tool or integrated into other health-related applications.

Features
BMI Calculation: The main functionality of the application is to calculate the BMI based on the user's input for height and weight.

BMI Classification: After calculating the BMI, the application will provide a classification based on the calculated value (e.g., underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese).

Unit Conversion: The application supports both metric (centimeters and kilograms) and imperial (inches and pounds) units, allowing users to choose their preferred measurement system.

Responsive Design: The BMI calculator has a responsive design, making it accessible and easy to use on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

Technology Stack
The BMI calculator project uses the following technologies:

Front-end: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
Unit Conversion: Conversion formulas and functions for metric to imperial units and vice versa.
Styling: CSS Flexbox and responsive design principles.
